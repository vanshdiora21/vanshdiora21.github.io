```

### Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages

### Step 4: Access Your Website
Your website will be available at: `https://yourusername.github.io`

## Adding Your Content

### Required Images (Replace Placeholders)
Upload these to the `assets/` folder:

1. **Your Professional Photo**
   - Rename to: `profile-placeholder.jpg`
   - Size: 400x400 pixels
   - Professional headshot

2. **Project Screenshots** (600x400 pixels each):
   - `pairs-trading-placeholder.jpg`
   - `options-pricing-placeholder.jpg` 
   - `lbo-modeling-placeholder.jpg`
   - `ai-chatbot-placeholder.jpg`

3. **Your Resume**
   - Save as: `Vansh_Diora_Resume.pdf`
   - Current version in PDF format

### Updating Content
Edit `index.html` to customize:
- Contact information (phone, email)
- LinkedIn and GitHub URLs
- Project descriptions and links
- Work experience details
- Skills and technologies

## Custom Domain (Optional)

### If You Want a Custom Domain (like vanshdiora.com):
1. Buy domain from registrar (GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.)
2. Add a `CNAME` file to your repository root with your domain:
   ```
   vanshdiora.com
   ```
3. Configure DNS settings at your registrar:
   - Add CNAME record: `www` â†’ `yourusername.github.io`
   - Add A records for apex domain:
     ```
     185.199.108.153
     185.199.109.153
     185.199.110.153
     185.199.111.153
     ```
4. Enable custom domain in GitHub Pages settings

## Troubleshooting

### Website Not Loading?
- Check that repository is named correctly: `yourusername.github.io`
- Verify GitHub Pages is enabled in Settings â†’ Pages
- Wait 5-10 minutes after enabling (deployment takes time)
- Check for any error messages in Settings â†’ Pages

### Images Not Showing?
- Verify image files are in `assets/` folder
- Check that filenames match exactly (case-sensitive)
- Ensure image files are under 10MB each

### Form Not Working?
- The contact form is set to simulation mode
- Follow instructions in README.md to connect with Formspree or Netlify

### Need to Update Content?
- Edit files on GitHub (click file â†’ edit button â†’ commit changes)
- Or use git to push updates from your computer
- Changes appear within 1-2 minutes

## Performance Tips

### Optimize Images
- Compress images before uploading (use TinyPNG.com)
- Keep project images under 500KB each
- Profile photo under 200KB

### SEO Optimization
- Update meta description in index.html
